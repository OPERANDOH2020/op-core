    Policy DB

    The Policy Database that stores three types of documents in dedicated collections.   1) User Privacy Policy. Each OPERANDO user has one UPP document describing their privacy policies for each of the OSP services they are subscribed to. The UPP contains the current B2C privacy settings for a subscribed to OSP. The UPP contains the users privacy preferences. The UPP contains the G2C access policies for the OSP with justification for access.   2) The legislation policies. The regulations entered into OPERANDO using the OPERANDO regulation API.   3) The OSP descriptions and data requests. For each OSP its privacy policy, its access control rules, and the data it requests (as a workflow). For B2C, the set of privacy settings is stored. 

    OpenAPI spec version: 1.0.0
