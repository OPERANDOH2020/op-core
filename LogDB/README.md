#LogDB

In this first approach it is being used LOG4J to perform the insertions in a declarative way.
Just for testing purposes, there have been created 2 log4j configuration files: one that uses a MySQL database and other one using derby database. 

The module has three different packages:
- client: it is a library that facilitates the LOG addition from other modules [Detailed package Description](eu.operando.core.logdb.client/README.md)
- server
