# Online Service Provider Enforcement (OSE Component)

## Overview
The Online Service Provider Enforcement component (OSE) ensures that Online
Service Providers (OSPs) behaviour in terms of their usage of a user's personal 
data complies with the privacy policy statements that they make and register
with Operando about usage of private data; and also creates reports based upon
the OSP's stated privacy policy and functional usage that can be used by
privacy experts to evaluate the extent to which they comply with current
privacy regulations. 

More specifically, the OSE module has the following key functional purposes: 
* The OSE component manages when a G2C OSP changes its behaviourâ€”ensuring that user policies 
are updated to comply with GDPR regulations. That is, users are notified of all changes to the
privacy policy; and their consents are set to false for the changes. They must then
choose to opt-in or not.

* The OSE component audits the behaviour of an OSP in regards to its stated
privacy policy. An audit report can be produced on request that evaluates data
access requests and reports policy conflicts.

* The OSE produces consent reports that can be used to analyse how users make
choices about their personal data.

## Installation

The component is implemented as a Maven project. Therefore, to install and
deploy the OSE component, first ensure that Maven is installed and then execute
the "jetty:run" target goal in Maven. This can be performed as followed via
the command line:

```
mvn clean package jetty:run
```

The software component is then accessible via the HTTP endpoint:

```
http://domainhost:port
```

There are then four REST interface endpoints that can be interacted with.

The OSP API, which is a set of methods for managing OSP policy changes and auditing behaviour:
```
http://domainhost:port/osps
```

The Consent API, which is a set of methods for producing consent reports:
```
http://domainhost:port/consents
```

The Monitor API, which is a set of methods for monitoring the OSE component:
```
http://domainhost:port/monitor
```

The Regulation API, which is a set of methods for adding new regulations:
```
http://domainhost:port/regulations
```

The full REST API documentation for each of these four interfaces is included in
the following section.

## Programming Guide

The following programming guide describes each and every method available from
the OSE component, with working examples to illustrate how to execute each
REST call.

### Consent API ###

#### GET Consent Report ####
----
This method produces and returns a consent report about all users, which is a JSON document 
describing whether consent has been given or not to a particular action of the
OSP as described in its privacy policy. For example, an action policy could be
"Doctor reads Patient's BMI data".

The method can produce four different types of reports based upon the parameters
provided to the call.

1. An anonymised list of all access consents by all users subscribed to the OSP.
2. The list of all access consents by all users subscribed to the OSP for a specific field.
3. The list of all access consents by all users subscribed to the OSP by a specific role.
3. The list of all access consents by all users subscribed to the OSP by a specific role for a specific field.

### OSP API ###

#### Change Privacy Reason Policy ####
----
Notify Operando that a change has been made to an OSP's privacy reason policy. This
will trigger internal checks on this policy change. In particular, all access policies
that relate to the change in reason are analysed, and where an OSP requests access to
data with a reason change then all users subscribed to the OSP are notified of the
changes, and their UPP is changed to remove consents given for the previous reason; and
they are asked to review their consents.

For example, an OSP may state that a person may access your e-mail data for service notifications. 
However, they may change this to access e-mail to share with 3rd party companies for marketing.
The user is notified and the OSP cannot access the email until consent is given back for the new
reason.

* **URL**

  /osps/{osp-id}/reason/

* **Method:**

  `PUT` 
  
*  **URL Params**

   **Required:**
 
   `osp-id=[alphanumeric]`

    This is a path parameter entered in the URL. It is the unique Operando identifier
    given to an OSP.

*  **Message content**

  The message contains the new access reason for accessing data. This is in the following JSON format:
  
  ```json
    {
      "reasonid": "string",
      "datauser": "string",
      "datasubjecttype": "string",
      "datatype": "string",
      "reason": "string"
    }
  ```
  **reasonid** : The reason id is the id of the reason that has changed. If it is a new reason, then the new id must be provided.
  **datauser** : Who is using the data?
  **datasubjecttype** : Whose is this data?
  **datatype** : The category of the data this reason is about e.g. contact information.
  **reason** : The free text reason explaining why the OSP is using this data.
  
* **Success Response:**

  * **Code:** 200 <br />
  * However, the subscribed users should all receive notification messages about the change. Further, all subscribed
  UPP policies will be updates in the database.
 
* **Sample Calls:**

1.  Notify the OSE of the reason policy change.

    `curl -H "Content-type: application/json" -X PUT -D {{

    }} "http://hostname:port/osps/1111111111/reason"`

#### Change Privacy Access Policy ####
----
Notify Operando that a change has been made to an OSP's privacy access policy. This
will trigger internal checks on this policy change. Users subscribed to the OSP are notified of the
changes, and their UPP is changed to remove consents given for the previous access policies; and
they are asked to review their consents for the new and changed consents. Deleted access policies
are removed from the UPP too.

* **URL**

  /osps/{osp-id}/

* **Method:**

  `PUT` 
  
*  **URL Params**

   **Required:**
 
   `osp-id=[alphanumeric]`

    This is a path parameter entered in the URL. It is the unique Operando identifier
    given to an OSP.

*  **Message content**

  The message contains the new access full OSP policy. This is in the following JSON format:
  
  ```json
    {
      "osp_policy_id": "string",
      "policy_text": "string",
      "policy_url": "string",
      "workflow": [
        {
          "requester_id": "string",

  * However, the subscribed users should all receive notification messages about the change. Further, all subscribed
  UPP policies will be updates in the database.
 
* **Sample Calls:**

1.  Notify the OSE of the reason policy change.

    `curl -H "Content-type: application/json" -X PUT "http://hostname:port/osps/1111111111/"`

#### Run an OSP Audit ####
